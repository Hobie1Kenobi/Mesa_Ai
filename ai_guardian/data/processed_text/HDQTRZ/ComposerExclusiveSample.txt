5. ROYALTIES:
(a) Publisher shall pay to Writer:

(i) Fifty percent (50%) of all monies actually received by Publisher from the exploitation of the Compositions in foreign countries; provided, however, that no such royalties shall be payable with respect to royalties received from Publisher's affiliated companies which are deemed to be the collection by Publisher itself of royalties, but, in such event, Publisher shall pay to Writer the amount specified in Paragraph 5(a)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) hereof, whichever is applicable.

(ii) Fifty percent (50%) of any and all net sums actually received by Publisher (after deducting any monies payable by Publisher to collection agents, licensees, joint ventures, co-publishers, administrators, legal representatives and subpublishers) from mechanical reproductions (including electrical transcriptions, non-permanent digital downloads and transferable digital downloads) licensed by Publisher or its agent where a compulsory mechanical license may be or is obtained;

(iii) Fifty percent (50%) of any and all net sums actually received by Publisher (after deducting any monies payable by Publisher to collection agents, joint ventures, co-publishers, administrators, legal representatives and subpublishers) for mechanical reproductions (including electrical transcriptions and digital downloads) of the Compositions licensed by Publisher where a compulsory mechanical license may not be obtained;

(iv) Fifty percent (50%) of any and all net sums actually received by Publisher (after deducting any monies payable by Publisher to collection agents, joint ventures, co-publishers, administrators, legal representatives and subpublishers) from the print publication of the Compositions, including without limitation, sheet music, orchestrations, octavo music and octavo arrangements, folios, songbooks, personality and picture folios and other publications thereof;

(v) Fifty percent (50%) of any and all net sums actually received by Publisher (after deducting any monies payable by Publisher to collection agents, joint ventures, co-publishers, administrators, legal representatives and subpublishers) from synchronization and dramatic performance licenses and from commercial advertisements;

(vi) Fifty percent (50%) of Writer's public performance royalties throughout the world; provided that:

(A) Writer hereby directs the Society to pay directly to Writer Writer's public performance royalties throughout the United States, its territories and possessions; and

(B) Writer hereby directs the Society and any and all other performing rights societies to pay to Publisher (or as Publisher may from time to time direct) all public performance royalties throughout the world outside the United States, its territories and possessions, and Publisher agrees to pay Writer as provided herein.

(vii) Fifty percent (50%) of any and all other net sums actually received by Publisher (after deducting any monies payable by Publisher to collection agents, joint ventures, co-publishers, administrators, legal representatives and subpublishers) from the exploitation of the Compositions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Publisher shall not be obligated to pay royalties based on monies or advances received which are specifically attributed to rights in and to musical compositions other than the Compositions.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained:

(i) The term "sums actually received by Publisher" shall mean all monies earned by the Compositions and actually received by Publisher (not its subsidiaries or affiliated companies), less all expenses incurred by Publisher in connection with the collection of such monies, and less all payments of any nature contracted for or required to be made to others, including, without limitation, royalties or any part thereof, required to be paid to or retained by any agent, co-publisher, sub-publisher, collection agent or attorney. In the event that Publisher shall recognize performance income directly from the Society or from a similar organization in foreign territories, such sums shall be deemed to be "sums actually received by Publisher".

(ii) If Publisher shall grant to any person, firm or corporation a license to mechanically reproduce any Composition upon parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the Composition in return for a royalty which is less than the full statutory rate established by the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. Section 115), and which represents the entire amount to be paid by the licensee for the Composition without division or deduction by the licensee (other than for taxes), except the right of the licensee to deduct a container charge, then the royalty accruing to Writer shall be a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the net sums received by Publisher from such licensee or its designee. If Writer and Publisher shall disagree as to whether a lower royalty shall be charged, Publisher's decision shall be final.

(iii) With respect to mechanical reproductions of the Compositions on phonograph records sold by Publisher or companies owned in whole or in part by, owning in whole or in part, or under common ownership with Publisher (hereinafter referred to as "Related Companies"), where the record company is responsible for manufacturing, publishing, distributing and selling records, the controlled composition clause of the record company shall apply and Writer hereby agrees to such clause, provided that Writer's share of mechanical royalties will be not less than fifty percent (50%) of the amount the Related Companies allocate to the publishing share.

(iv) In the event Writer shall furnish the services of any other person, or shall collaborate with any other person, or shall use the musical or literary material of any other person, or shall adapt or arrange the musical or literary material of any other person, in connection with any composition, idea, or title hereunder, Writer shall be solely responsible for payment to any such other person, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Writer with such other person and Publisher, and Writer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Publisher against any claim or demand by any such person, and any expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by Publisher in connection therewith, and Publisher may, at its option, withhold from any payments due to Writer hereunder, an amount equal to such payments.

(v) Publisher shall have the right to maintain reserves against returns and/or credits of any nature in calculating monies payable to Writer hereunder, which reserves shall be in amounts which Publisher has a reasonable basis to believe, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, to be necessary. In no event shall any reserve be maintained for a period longer than two (2) years for mechanical royalties, and four (4) years for all other royalties, after which time all reserves shall be liquidated.

6. ACCOUNTING:
(a) Publisher shall use reasonable best efforts to compute the royalties earned by Writer pursuant to this Agreement by the last day of March and September of each year for the semi-annual periods ending the preceding December 31 and June 30, respectively. All such computations of royalties shall be made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, and each such royalty computation shall be accompanied by payment of the net amount of royalties, if any, shown thereby to be due Writer. Publisher shall submit to Writer royalty statements, in the form customarily used by Publisher, for each such period. No royalty statement or any other accounting rendered by Publisher shall be subject to objection by Writer for any reason unless specific objection, in writing, stating the basis thereof, is given to Publisher within three (3) years after the date rendered. If Publisher has made an error in any such royalty payment, Publisher shall rectify such error by making such adjustment in the next royalty statement prepared and submitted hereunder.

(b) Publisher's books relating to the Compositions shall be open for inspection by a certified public accountant designated by Writer, who is not then engaged in an outstanding examination of Publisher's books and records on behalf of a person or entity other than Writer, only for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of statements sent to Writer, at all reasonable times during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. Such inspection shall be made at the place where Publisher normally keeps such books, shall be conducted in a manner that will not disrupt Publisher's normal business operations, and shall be limited to books relating to the Compositions. Examination of any particular royalty period may be made only once, and Writer may not conduct such an examination more than once in any calendar year.
