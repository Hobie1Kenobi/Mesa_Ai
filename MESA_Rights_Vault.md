# MESA Rights Vault
## Privacy-First Portable Music Rights on Base

---

# Executive Summary

MESA Rights Vault is a groundbreaking platform built on Base that provides musicians with privacy-focused portable rights management. By enabling artists to control who can access their rights data and how they share it across platforms, we're creating the foundation for a more fair, transparent, and artist-controlled music rights ecosystem.

## Key Value Propositions

- **Privacy-Preserving Rights Data**: Store and manage music rights with full privacy controls
- **Portable Rights Identity**: Take your verified rights credentials anywhere
- **Selective Disclosure**: Share only what's needed with specific parties
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Move rights data seamlessly between services
- **Artist-Controlled Access**: Musicians decide who sees their rights information

# The Problem

## Current Challenges in Music Rights Management

- **Data Silos**: Rights information locked in closed platforms
- **Privacy Vulnerabilities**: Artists forced to expose sensitive contract details
- **Limited Portability**: Difficult to move between music platforms
- **Fragmented Identity**: Multiple accounts and credentials across services
- **Loss of Control**: Rights data controlled by third parties, not artists

## MESA Rights Vault Solution

- **Unified Rights Vault**: Securely store all rights data in one artist-controlled location
- **Privacy By Design**: Zero-knowledge proofs to verify without revealing
- **Universal Portability**: Rights data that moves with the artist
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Artists own and control their rights identity
- **Granular Access Control**: Precise control over who sees what and when
