   - Integration examples

## Notes for Developers

- **Action Required:** Verify all deployed contracts on BaseScan using the details from `foundry.toml` and deployment scripts. Start with `RightsVault`.
- All contracts are ready for integration testing
- Use the provided ABIs in the `scripts` directory for contract interactions
- Remember to always use the privacy layer when submitting rights data
- Monitor gas usage with the `REPORT_GAS` flag enabled
- Contract addresses are also saved in `scripts/deployed_contracts.json`

## Simple Explanation for the Team

### What We Built
We created a system called MESA Rights Vault that helps musicians and artists protect their music rights on the blockchain. Think of it like a digital lockbox for your music ownership information, but with special features that make it secure and easy to use.

### What It Does
1. **Stores Music Rights**: Keeps track of who owns what music
2. **Verifies Ownership**: Lets people prove they own music without revealing private details
3. **Tracks Usage**: Monitors how music is being used
4. **Manages Royalties**: Automatically splits payments between artists, producers, and publishers

### How We Built It
We used smart contracts on the Base blockchain (a faster, cheaper version of Ethereum) to create this system. Each part of the system is a separate contract that handles a specific job:

- **RightsVault**: The main storage for all rights information
- **MusicRightsVault**: Special storage for music-specific rights
- **VerificationRegistry**: Keeps track of who can verify rights
- **EnhancedVerification**: Allows multiple people to verify rights together
- **UsageTracker**: Monitors how music is being used
- **RoyaltyManager**: Handles splitting payments between different parties

### How to Interact With It
Right now, you can interact with these contracts in several ways:

1. **Through the Frontend**: We're building a web interface that will make it easy to use
2. **Direct Contract Interaction**: Developers can interact with the contracts using tools like ethers.js or web3.js
3. **Scripts**: We've created Python scripts that demonstrate how to use the system

### Moving to Base Mainnet
For the Base Batches hackathon, we'll be moving from Base Sepolia (testnet) to Base Mainnet. This means:

1. **Real Value**: The system will handle real transactions with actual value
2. **Production Ready**: We'll need to ensure everything is secure and optimized
3. **Gas Optimization**: We'll need to make sure transactions are as cheap as possible
4. **User Experience**: We'll focus on making the system easy to use for non-technical users

The good news is that our contracts are already designed to work on both testnet and mainnet - we just need to deploy them to the main network and connect them to our frontend application.

### Next Steps for the Team
1. Test the frontend application with the deployed contracts
2. Create user guides for how to use the system
3. Prepare for the mainnet deployment
4. Plan marketing and outreach to potential users

Remember: We've built something that solves a real problem for musicians and artists. The technology is complex, but the value proposition is simple: "We help you protect your music rights and get paid fairly."
