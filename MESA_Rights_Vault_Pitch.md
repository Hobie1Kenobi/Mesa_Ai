## Privacy-First Portable Music Rights on Base

# The Problem

Musicians face a broken rights management system:

- **Privacy Exploited**: Contract details exposed to countless third parties
- **Locked In**: Rights data trapped in siloed platforms
- **Loss of Control**: Artists don't control their own rights information
- **Fragmented Identity**: Multiple accounts across different services

> "I have no idea who has access to my music rights information anymore."
> â€” Independent Artist
