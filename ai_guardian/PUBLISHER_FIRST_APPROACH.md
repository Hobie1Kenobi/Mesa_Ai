# MESA AI Guardian: Publisher-First Approach

## Executive Summary

MESA AI Guardian provides blockchain-enhanced rights management for music creators. This document outlines our publisher-first approach that minimizes the friction traditionally associated with blockchain technology while preserving its security and transparency benefits.

## Why Publishers First?

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Publishers can register entire catalogs rather than individual tracks
2. **Technical Readiness**: Publishers often have technical staff who can handle integration
3. **Cost Effectiveness**: Bulk operations reduce per-track gas costs
4. **Industry Familiarity**: Publishers understand rights management workflows
5. **Greater Impact**: Onboarding one publisher can secure thousands of works
